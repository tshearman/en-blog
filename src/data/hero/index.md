As an applied mathematician, I thrive on tackling challenging problems and communicating their solutions, while relying on numerical computation and visualization to inspire rigorous mathematics. With 4 years experience as a data scientist, I leverage my expertise to translate strategic business motivations into rigorous mathematical formulations and extract actionable insights using visualization and modern computational frameworks.

My research interests are in Optimization, Calculus of Variations, Materials and Multiple-scale Analysis, Uncertainty Quantification, Causal Inference and Machine Learning.
